# INF112 libGDX + Maven template 
Simple skeleton with [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/). See the tutorial in [Filer / Tutorials](https://mitt.uib.no/courses/33532/files/folder/Tutorials) on Mitt UiB. 


# Maven Setup
This project comes with a working Maven `pom.xml` file. You should be able to import it into Eclipse using *File → Import → Maven → Existing Maven Projects* (or *Check out Maven Projects from SCM* to do Git cloning as well). You can also build the project from the command line with `mvn clean compile` and test it with `mvn clean test`.

Pay attention to these folders:
* `src/main/java` – Java source files go here (as usual for Maven)
* `src/main/resources` – data files go here, for example in an `assets` sub-folder
* `src/test/java` – JUnit tests
* `target/classes` – compiled Java class files

You should probably edit the `pom.xml` and fill in details such as the project `name` and `artifactId`:


```xml

	< !-- FIXME - set group id -->
	<groupId>inf112.skeleton.app</groupId>
	< !-- FIXME - set artifact name -->
	<artifactId>gdx-app</artifactId>
	<version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
	<packaging>jar</packaging>

	< !-- FIXME - set app name -->
	<name>mvn-app</name>
	< !-- FIXME change it to the project's website -->
	<url>http://www.example.com</url>
```

	
## Running
You can run the project from Eclipse, or with Maven using `mvn exec:java`. Change the main class by modifying the `main.class` setting in `pom.xml`:

```
		<main.class>Main</main.class>
```

If you run `mvn package` you'll get a everything bundled up into a JAR file
* `target/*.jar` – your compiled project, packaged in a JAR file

## Jar Files

If you run `mvn package` you get everything bundled up into a `.jar` file + a ‘fat’ Jar file where all the necessary dependencies have been added:

* `target/NAME-VERSION.jar` – your compiled project, packaged in a JAR file
* `target/NAME-VERSION-fat.jar` – your JAR file packaged with dependencies

Run Jar files with, for example, `java -jar target/javafx-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar`.

## Eclipse Setup

It's usually smart to change Eclipse's Maven settings so that it'll automatically download Javadocs and the source code for your dependencies:
